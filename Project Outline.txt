Scope

1) Lightweight Linux distro similar to Puppy/Pybian with
	a) a web browser with modern codecs, 
	b)audio, microphone and video drivers if equipment exists
	c)common file type compatability with open source or custom software
	d)a lightweight Integrated Development Environment (IDE) capable of running/compiling multiple languages
	e)file storage and Git/other means of upload for same
	f) Library of offline coding tutorials and resources, comprehensive with everything needed for self-learning
	g) Total file size of less than 2gb and capable of running on 1995-spec machines and Raspberry Pi

2) Android Application with
	a) a lightweight Integrated Development Environment (IDE) capable of running/compiling multiple languages
	b) Library of offline coding tutorials and resources, comprehensize with everything needed for self-learning
	c) Total file size of less than 12MB and specs consistent with stable deployment on Android 4.4 Kitkat

3) JVM installer with 
		a) a lightweight Integrated Development Environment (IDE) capable of running/compiling multiple languages
		b) Library of offline coding tutorials and resources, comprehensize with everything needed for self-learning
		c) File storage for retrieval of common file types  
		d) Total file size of less than 12MB and specs consistent with stable deployment on Smart TV or similar from 2005

4) Assembly Translation of JVM installer for modifcaion into exotic/minimalist applications (IE Graphing Calculators, command-line only pre-1990s terminals, Cray II, Gameboy Color etc)
